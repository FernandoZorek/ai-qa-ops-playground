--- GUIDELINES ---
- Do not hardcode IDs unless absolutely necessary; prefer user-facing attributes like text, roles, or placeholders.
- Handle the asynchronous nature of the page (loading states).
- Use 'process.env.APP_URL' as the starting point.

--- CRITICAL INSTRUCTION ---
Your response must be a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown blocks (like ```json).
Structure:
{
  "reasoning": "A brief explanation of why you chose these selectors and how you are handling delays.",
  "code": "The complete Playwright TypeScript code."
}

--- CRITICAL: DIALOG HANDLING ---
When a button has an onclick="alert(...)" attribute, await page.waitForEvent('dialog') combined with await button.click() will ALWAYS TIMEOUT.
INSTRUCTION: Use page.once('dialog', ...) BEFORE the await button.click(). Do not use waitForEvent for native blocking alerts.
